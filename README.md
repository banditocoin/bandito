What is Bandito?
----------------
Bandito is a brand new, scrypt based cryptocurrency forked from Litecoin 
and branded for the Bandito Boys(TM), Abner Vaca and Kirk Jerkems of NoPixel.

I've done this as something of a weekend project to keep my skills sharp and will
work on and maintain it pretty much at my leisure. If people show any real
interest or it picks up any type of traction, I may pay it more attention.

In any case, enjoy and have fun!!

(Generic Crypto README.md stuff below)

Bandito is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bandito uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bandito Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Bandito Core software, see [https://www.banditocoin.com](https://www.banditocoin.com).
